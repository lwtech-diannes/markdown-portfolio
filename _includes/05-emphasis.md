I've been studying for *two years* at **Lake Washington Institute of Technology** where I recently received my __AAS__ in **Computing and Software Development**. I'm currently pursuing my **BAS** in the same area of study.  Programming languages I have studied include: **Java, C#, C++, JavaScript, HTML, MySQL, PHP**.  I have also learned about __Android__  in the **Mobile Applications** course and have written a few small apps.  Programming for me is **fun** and _exciting_! There's SO MUCH to learn and do.  I'm so happy I made this my _new_ career choice.  I look forward to making some _**amazing**_ projects!
